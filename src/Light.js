              <p>Different plants need different amounts of light. For example, cacti like to sit in a spot with a lot of light, while small and trailing plants prefer to be in a shadier spot.</p>

                    <h2>The Quick Guide To Three Main Types of Light</h2>
                    <p>The three light requirements plants need are based on where they would rather be outdoors. There are different ways that light can be blocked from coming into a room. We need to think about this when choosing the type of light we want to use indoors.</p>
                    <h3>Where should I put a plant that requires Direct Sun?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Window placement: </strong>
                        Directly in the window
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Hours of sun hitting the leaves:</strong>
                         8+ hours
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Window options:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>South facing window: directly in the window</li>
                        <li>West facing window: directly in the window</li>
                        <li>East facing window: directly in the window, but this may not be enough light</li>
                        <li>North facing window: won't get enough light.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The best place to put a plant that requires direct sun is right in front of a south-facing window. If you don’t have a south-facing window, the next best place would be east or west-facing windows. If no windows are available, the next best thing would be to use grow lights.</p>
                    <h3>Where should I put a plant that requires Bright Indirect Light?  </h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Hours of sun hitting leaves:</strong>
                         a few hours of sunlight on the leaves or extremely bright all day.
                    </p>

                        <li>West facing window: directly in the window or a bit away from the window.</li>
                        <li>South facing window: not directly in the window, to the sides would be best.</li>
                        <li>North facing window: directly in the window, but it better not be obstructed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A plant that requires bright indirect light can go in any window except a north-facing one. The best place for these plants would be east or west-facing window. If you have a south-facing window, the plant should not be placed directly in front of it but to the side of the window instead.</p>
                    <h3>Where should I put a plant that requires Shade?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Hours of sun hitting leaves: </strong>
                        1-3 hours per day
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Window options for Shade: </strong>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>East facing window: place it directly in the window or close to it</li>
                        <li>North facing window: place it directly in the window or close by</li>
                        <li>West facing window: place it further away from the window or in a spot where it gets cooler late evening sun.</li>
                        <li>South facing window: place it further away from the window where the sun is less intense.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Outdoors they would go under a tree on the north side of a building. Indoors they can do best Away from windows; south-facing windows are okay if the plant is placed further away from the glass. The best place to put a plant that requires shade is on east or north-facing window.</p>
                    <h3>Can plants handle no natural light?</h3>
                    <p>No plant can live without light. They need it to stay alive. Some plants can survive in low light conditions, but they will grow more slowly than plants that get a lot of light. If you don't have any natural light, we recommend using a grow light like our HIGHLIGHT plant light or one of the many other options</p>
                    <h3>What happens if I give a plant too much light?</h3>
                    <p>When a plant gets more light, it will use more water. This is because light helps plants grow and makes them use more water. If you increase how much light a plant gets, you will need to increase how much water you give it.</p>
                    <p>You should move if your plants suffer from stress and their leaves are burnt. If the leaves are dropping, it might be because there is too much light. But your plant may also be adapting to its new location.</p>
                    <h3>What happens if I don't give a plant enough light?</h3>
                    <p>If you give your plants less light than they need, you will also need to water them less. For example, if you have a zz plant in a dark corner, you would water it once every month or two instead of every week.</p>
                    <p>Many plants that tolerate low light or live in the shade can survive in conditions with much lower light. If you are giving something that needs direct sun bright indirect light, you might see some leaves drop, and the plant might look limp because it cannot get what it needs to live its best life.</p>

                    <p>Here is an extremely detailed guide on how to give plants the right amount of light that we put together for our employees </p>

                        <span>Photosynthesis 101</span>
                    </h1>
                    <p>Light is important for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is how plants turn sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy. Photosynthesis helps plants to grow and survive.</p>
                    <p>Photosynthesis is the process that helps plants create their own food. This happens in special parts of plant cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts use energy from the sun to help plants grow and stay alive.</p>
                    <p> Photosynthesis needs three things: light, water, and carbon dioxide. The roots absorb the water from the soil, and the leaves have special cells that absorb light and carbon dioxide.</p>
                    <p> Sunlight is the best source of light for plants because it has a balanced wavelength. It's composed of seven different wavelengths. The most important ones for the plants are red and blue. These wavelengths help in root development, leaf and flower growth, and water and carbon dioxide regulation.</p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Houseplants need light close to the conditions found in their natural habitat. Houseplants we grow in our home come from the tropics, where light conditions range from the full sun (six hours or more of direct sun) to full shade (less than two hours of direct sun). </span>

                    <p>
                        <span>The outdoor sun is different from light passing through a window. Obstructions (e.g., trees, overhangs, eaves, and buildings), seasons, and directional exposure affect the amount and quality of light that our plants get.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>It is important to consider the light situation we have at home to match the care requirements of the plants we own.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>The intensity and duration of sunlight depend on the position of your window or balcony relative to the sun. In the northern hemisphere, the sun rises in the northeast, peaks midday in the south, and sets in the west. This directly affects the amount of light in each directional exposure.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>When one of our associates asks about the lighting conditions at home, we are trying to imagine the space at home. Is the plant going to be near the window, off to the side of the window, or a few feet away from the window? Which direction is the window facing?

                        <span>Some regular artificial light lacks some of the wavelengths necessary for photosynthesis. For example, an incandescent bulb lacks blue wavelengths within the PAR spectrum. A mix of fluorescent and incandescent bulbs can provide a good balance of wavelengths for plant growth and survival.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>Studies suggest that grow lights can help plants grow and thrive. It is important to know that sunlight is still plants' best light source. This is because sunlight has other wavelengths that grow lights don’t have. Sunlight is also very dynamic. Weather, clouds, time, and the sun’s position affect the plants differently. </span>
